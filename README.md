## Our Culture
We're fond of saying that, "We are pirates! Not the Navy." We pride ourselves on working, thinking, and investing with extreme independence. Because we believe that all successful investing is a single-player in nature. To get exceptional results, you have to work and act in an exceptionally different way.

Here are some of our core values:
